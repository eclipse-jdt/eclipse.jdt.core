    <h1>
      Annotation Processing
    </h1>
    <p>Annotation processors can generate additional Java code or other files, and produce problem markers,
    based on Java 5 (JSR-175) annotations.  The Annotation Processing preference pane permits configuration 
    of preferences that apply to all processors in a project or workspace.  The <a href="factorypath.html">
    Factory Path preference pane</a> specifies which processors are enabled and permits configuration of 
    individual processors.
    <h2>
    	Generated source directory
    </h2>
    <p>Files will be generated on disk relative to the specified directory.  By default this directory
    is named &quot;.apt_generated&quot;, which causes it to be filtered out of the Package Explorer view.  
    Generated files have the &quot;derived&quot; bit set; in a clean, all derived files under the
    generated source directory will be removed.  It is recommended to only
    use this directory for files generated by processors; do not place any manually created files under
    this directory, and do not use a pre-existing directory as the generated source directory.
    <h2>
    	Processor options
    </h2>
    <p>Options entered here will be available to the processors via the AnnotationProcessorEnvironment
    interface.  Certain options are automatically provided to the processors; entering them in this dialog
    will have no effect, since the automatically provided values will override any values set here.  
    The automatic options are described <a href="automatic_processor_options.html">here</a>. More
    information about processor options is in the topic on <a href="processor_options_input.html">the
    Processor Options input dialog</a>.
